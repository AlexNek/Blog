## Overview

Blazor, Microsoft's web framework for building interactive client-side web UIs with .NET, has gained significant traction in recent years. As a manager, understanding its strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases is crucial for making informed decisions about your technology stack.

## What is Blazor?
At its core, Blazor is Microsoft's answer to the question: "Can we build web UIs with C# instead of JavaScript?" The resounding answer is yes. Blazor allows developers to leverage their C# skills to create both client-side and server-side web applications, effectively bridging the gap between .NET development and modern web technologies.

Blazor comes in two primary hosting model:

1. **Blazor WebAssembly**: This client-side solution runs entirely in the browser, leveraging WebAssembly to execute .NET code directly on the client.

2. **Blazor Server**: A server-side implementation where the UI updates are managed through a SignalR connection, keeping a thin client in the browser.

 .

## .NET 8.0 Enhancements

The release of .NET 8.0 marks a significant milestone for Blazor, ushering in a new era of web development. Let's delve into the transformative enhancements that set this version apart:

### Unified Rendering Model

Blazor now features a **unified rendering model**, eliminating the need to choose exclusively between WebAssembly and Server rendering. Developers can seamlessly mix server-side and client-side rendering within the same application. This flexibility not only addresses performance concerns but also provides greater architectural freedom, allowing for more dynamic and responsive applications.

### Enhanced User Experience

Improvements in navigation and form handling have significantly elevated the user experience, delivering interactions that rival those of native single-page applications (SPAs). The introduction of **streaming rendering** allows components to be progressively painted, preserving existing DOM elements and minimizing unnecessary refreshes. This results in smoother transitions and faster load times.

### Performance Leap

.NET 8 introduces impressive performance gains across ASP.NET Core, [with reports](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8/) indicating an 18% improvement in JSON handling and a 24% increase in performance on the Fortunes benchmark compared to .NET 7. These enhancements position Blazor as a formidable contender among high-performance web frameworks, making it an attractive choice for developers focused on speed and efficiency.

### Boosted Developer Productivity

Blazor enhances developer productivity with innovative features like **QuickGrid**, which simplifies data table creation by incorporating built-in sorting, filtering, and pagination functionalities. This allows developers to concentrate on core application logic rather than repetitive tasks.

Additionally, the ongoing development of **Blazor Fluent UI Web Components** provides a modern Microsoft look and feel. These pre-built, customizable components ensure design consistency and streamline development processes, empowering teams to build responsive and engaging web applications while reducing boilerplate code.

### Diverse Rendering Options in .NET 8

.NET 8 introduces several rendering options tailored to various application needs:

1. **Static Server-Side Rendering (Static SSR)**
   - Renders components on the server without interactivity.
   - Suitable for content-heavy sites with minimal interactivity needs.
   - Default mode for new Blazor components in .NET 8.

2. **Interactive Server Rendering**
   - Renders components on the server and maintains interactivity via a SignalR connection.
   - Good for applications requiring real-time server interactions.

3. **Interactive WebAssembly Rendering**
   - Renders and runs components entirely in the browser using WebAssembly.
   - Suitable for applications that need to run offline or with minimal server dependency.

4. **Interactive Auto Rendering**
   - Initially renders using Interactive Server, then switches to WebAssembly once the .NET runtime is downloaded.
   - Balances fast initial load times with client-side execution benefits.

5. **Streaming Rendering** *
   - Not a separate mode, but a feature that can be applied to other interactive modes (*).
   - Allows components to render incrementally, sending content to the client as soon as it's available.
   - Improves perceived performance, especially for components with long-running operations.

## Additional Considerations

- **Per-Component Render Modes**: Developers can specify render modes at the component level, allowing for a mix of rendering strategies within a single application.

- **Prerendering**: Available for interactive render modes, it generates initial HTML on the server for faster perceived load times.

- **Global vs. Local Configuration**: Render modes can be set globally for the entire application or locally for specific components.

- **Application State Management**: Currently, application state is not preserved when switching between render modes (e.g., from Interactive Server to Interactive WebAssembly). Developers should implement appropriate state management strategies to ensure state continuity across render mode transitions.

This comprehensive set of rendering options in .NET 8 provides developers with fine-grained control over how their Blazor applications render and execute, allowing for optimized performance and user experience based on specific application requirements.
 a unified rendering model, this addresses performance concerns and provides greater flexibility in application architecture:

3. **Blazor Unified**: Allowing mix server-side and client-side rendering within the same application. 
>Note: For the purposes of this article, we will use the name `Blazor Unified` as a shorthand for `Unified Full-Stack Model` or `Full Stack Web UI with Blazor`. This model enables you to opt for any of the various supported rendering modes (client rendering, server-side rendering, and static rendering) and switch between them on a per-component or per-page basis within a single application.

## Differences between Blazor Client, Blazor Server and Blazor Unified

### Blazor Client / WebAssembly

Blazor WebAssembly applications run entirely within the user's browser, with C# code and .NET libraries downloaded and executed client-side.

**Benefits:**

- **Offline Capabilities:** Can work without a permanent server/internet connection once downloaded.
- **Responsive UI:** Interactions can be very quick without server round-trips.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Processing is offloaded to the client's browser.
- **Deployable to Static File Servers or CDNs:** Blazor WebAssembly can be deployed to static file servers or content delivery networks (CDNs), offering flexibility in hosting and deployment options.

**General WASM drawbacks:**
- **Limited Browser Compatibility:**  WebAssembly depends on browser support. Although it is broadly supported in modern browsers, older versions may have limited compatibility, potentially affecting functionality for users on those platforms.
- **Client-Side Security Concerns:** Since the code runs on the client-side, sensitive logic or data is potentially exposed.  It's crucial to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms and avoid handling sensitive operations directly within the client-side code.

**Blazor specific drawbacks:**

- **Longer Initial Load Times:** Downloading the entire application and .NET runtime can slow initial loading. This is a particular concern for public-facing websites where first impressions and user engagement are crucial.
- **Performance Trade-offs:** Blazor WebAssembly can be slower than native .NET applications for CPU-intensive tasks. While .NET 8 introduces optimizations like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation to enhance runtime performance, it may also increase the overall application size.
- **Limited API Access:** Not all .NET APIs are available in the browser environment.
 >Note: Most System.Security.Cryptography APIs are not supported in Blazor WebAssembly due to browser sandbox constraints, lack of native cryptographic primitives, performance considerations, security concerns, and the preference for using browser-provided cryptographic APIs.

### Blazor Server

Blazor Server applications execute primarily on the server, with UI updates communicated to the client's browser over a SignalR connection.

**Benefits:**

- **Fast Initial Load:** Smaller download size leads to quicker initial page loads.
- **Full Server Resource Access:** Direct access to server-side resources like databases and file systems.
- **Enhanced Security:** Sensitive logic and data reside on the server, providing a higher level of security compared to client-side execution.
- **Reduced Client CPU Load:** Blazor Server handles most rendering and state management on the server, lowering the processing work for client devices. This is especially helpful for users with older or less powerful hardware.


**Drawbacks:**

- **Constant Connection Required:** A persistent connection between the browser and the server is necessary, which can lead to scalability challenges with a large number of concurrent users and might not be suitable for offline scenarios. 
- **Handling Long User Absences:** Blazor Server can be challenging for users who experience long absences due to potential session timeouts, data synchronization issues, and degraded user experience.
- ** Requires ASP.NET Core Hosting:**  Blazor Server applications rely on ASP.NET Core as the server-side runtime environment. This might not be ideal for projects already using different server-side technologies.
- **Potential Latency:** UI interactions involve server communication, possibly impacting responsiveness.


### Blazor Unified

The Blazor unified rendering model, introduced in .NET 8.0, provides a powerful way to combine Blazor Server and WebAssembly components within a single application. This unified approach gives developers greater flexibility in designing optimized web application architectures.

**Benefits:**

- **Flexibility:** Developers can choose the most suitable rendering mode for different parts of the application.
- **Optimized Performance:** Can leverage benefits of both Server and WebAssembly models where appropriate.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Applications can start with server-side rendering and transition to client-side execution when WebAssembly is available.
-  **Enhanced Scalability:** Distribute load across servers and clients, improving scalability for applications with high user loads.
-  **Seamless User Experience:** Provide a smooth and responsive user experience, even in scenarios with limited network connectivity.

**Considerations:**

- **Complexity:** Managing both server and client-side logic in a single application can introduce additional complexity into your application's architecture and development process. Mixing different rendering modes together with state management is not an easy task either.
- **Data Access:** Requires careful design to handle data access consistently across server and client components.
- **Development Experience:** Developers need to be familiar with both Blazor Server and WebAssembly paradigms.

### Performance and Scalability

- Blazor Server offers good initial performance but may face scalability challenges as user numbers increase. While specific numbers can vary greatly depending on application complexity and server resources, Microsoft has demonstrated that Blazor Server can handle [thousands (5,000-20,000)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/blazor-server-in-net-core-3-0-scenarios-and-performance/), of concurrent users. For precise capacity planning, it's recommended to conduct load testing specific to your application and infrastructure, for example [SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-concept-performance).

- Blazor WebAssembly offers excellent scalability and responsiveness after the initial load, but its startup time can vary from a few seconds to several tens of seconds due to factors like application complexity, network conditions, device hardware, and deployment configuration.

- Blazor Hybrid allows for optimizing performance by choosing the appropriate model for each component.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in the Blazor context, particularly with .NET 8, offers several advantages and configurations for web applications:

1. **Improved Performance and SEO**:
   - SSR allows the initial rendering of a Blazor application to be performed on the server, resulting in faster initial load times as the browser receives fully rendered HTML.
   - This approach enhances SEO because search engines can index the static HTML content more effectively compared to client-side rendered applications.

2. **Default Mode in .NET 8**:
   - In .NET 8, SSR is the default rendering mode for new Blazor applications. This shift reflects the trend towards leveraging server-side capabilities for better performance and efficiency.
 >Note: Not all Blazor component libraries fully support SSR. While SSR enables limited user interaction similar to native HTML (e.g., `<a>` links, forms), certain libraries require a specialized rendering mode for initial rendering, which may differ from SSR. 


3. **Use Cases**:
   - SSR is particularly beneficial for applications that handle static data or require fast page loads, such as business applications or online shopping sites.
   - It reduces computational load on client devices, making it suitable for devices with limited resources.

Overall, SSR in Blazor provides a robust framework for building performant and SEO-friendly web applications by leveraging server capabilities to deliver pre-rendered content efficiently.
